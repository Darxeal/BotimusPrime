# RLBot
This repository is related to [RLBot](http://www.rlbot.org/), a framework for running offline Rocket League bots. You can try both Botimus and Bumblebee by downloading RLBotGUI and the BotPack.

# Botimus Prime & Bumblebee
This repository contains two bots: Botimus Prime and Bumblebee. They share most of the code, but use a different strategy. Botimus can play solo or with different bots, while Bumblebee is designed to play with copies of itself as teammates. That's because it's a hivemind bot, which means one process is controlling all of the Bumblebees on one team. The ideal team is 3x Bumblebee.

# RLUtilities
The `rlutilities` folder contains a compiled pybind11 module. [RLUtilities](https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities) is a library with a lot of useful stuff for making Rocket League bots, such as querying the arena mesh, simulating the ball and partially the cars, linear algebra stuff and controllers for various mechanics.
